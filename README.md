This is the course repo for our 2022 summer workshop on R. Attendees include one undergraduate student and one rotation graduate student in the [Gene Regulatory Evolution lab](https://binhe-lab.org), two REU students in the [Interdisciplinary Evolutionary Sciences](https://biology.uiowa.edu/reu) program and one high school intern in the lab. We used the [Data Visualization in R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-visualization-dashboarding-with-r#courses) course by JHU and available on coursera as our material.
